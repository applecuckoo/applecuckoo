# My little corner of the web

Hello! I'm applecuckoo, and you're here because you probably stumbled on one of my comments on an issue somewhere.

I'm interested in many aspects of technology, especially computers!

Recently, I've been fiddling around with emulating and ripping, especially video game codecs. As such, a large majority of my activity these days is around those areas.

I use Dolphin (the Wii emulator, not the file browser) and vgmstream with its Audacious extension (for the Linux sound rippers, yes, it's worth building from source) quite extensively, with a bit of ffmpeg for transcoding cutscenes.

Check out my ripping progress in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/applecuckoo/3943b8d00508e2e78a4a31d3c683747b).
